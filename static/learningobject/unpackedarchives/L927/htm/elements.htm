      <p align="left"><strong>Uses</strong> - The biggest use of lithium compounds
        is to make glass, ceramics, and aluminium. Lithium is used to make synthetic
        rubber, greases and other lubricants. It is used to make newer types
        of rechargeable batteries. Lithium mixed with other light-weight metals,
        such as aluminium and magnesium, forms strong, light-weight alloys. Some
        lithium, in the form of lithium carbonate or lithium citrate, is used
        as a medicine to treat gout (an inflammation of joints), and to treat
      serious mental illness.</p>
      <p><strong>Geology</strong> - Some lithium is recovered from the mineral
        spodumene. Commercial quantities of spodumene are in igneous rock deposits
      which have cooled very slowly allowing large crystals to form.</p>
      <p>Most lithium is recovered from brine (water saturated with salt), or
        water with a high concentration of lithium carbonate. Brines trapped
        in the earth's crust are the major source of lithium carbonate. These
        sources are less expensive to mine than those from rock, such as spodumene,
        petalite, and other lithium-bearing minerals.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font size="4"><a name="4"></a>Beryllium (Be)</font></strong></p>      
      <p align="left"><strong>Uses</strong> - It is commonly alloyed with nickel 
        for use in springs, electrodes and non-sparking tools. Alloyed with copper 
        gives a hard strong alloy with high resistance to wear and is used in 
        gyroscopes, computer parts, and instruments that need lightness and strength.<br>
          <br>
Other alloys are used as a structural material for high performance aircraft,
missiles, spacecraft (such as the USA space shuttle), and communication satellites.<br>
          <br>
It is a common component of ceramics.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Geology</strong> - Beryllium is found in a number of minerals. The
        most important mineral is beryl, [Be<font size="1" class="small">3</font>Al<font size="1" class="small">2</font>(SiO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>)<font size="1" class="small">6</font>],
        which is often found as hexagonal prisms. Aquamarine and emerald are
      precious forms of beryl.</p>

      <p>Borax Na<font size="1" class="small">2</font>B<font size="1" class="small">4</font>O<font size="1" class="small">7</font>.10H<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O is used as a water softener in washing powders and boron compounds are used in production of enamels for covering steel of refrigerators and washing machines. Boron compounds are also extensively used in the manufacture of borosilicate glasses. Boron filaments, a high-strength, lightweight material, are used for advanced aerospace structures and in fibre optics.</p>
      Boron as Boric acid is also used in household insecticides to control cockroaches, silverfish, ants, fleas, and other insects.
<p align="left"><strong>Geology</strong> - 


Boron is not found free in nature. It occurs usually as orthoboric acid in some volcanic spring waters and as borates in borax and colemanite.</p>

      <p align="left"><strong><font size="4"><a name="11" id="11"></a>Sodium (Na)</font></strong></p>      
      <p align="left"><strong>Uses</strong> - Sodium metal is used in the preparation 
        of lead compounds that were used as an anti-knock reagent in leaded petrol. 
        Sodium is a reagent in the manufacture of other chemical products because 
        it is a good reducing agent. Sodium compounds like table salt (sodium 
        chloride, NaCl), soda ash (sodium carbonate, Na<font size="1" class="small">2</font>CO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>), 
        baking soda (sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>, bicarb), 
        and caustic soda (sodium hydroxide, NaOH), are important to the paper, 
        glass, soap, textile, petroleum, chemical, and metal industries. Sodium 
        vapour is used in lamps for street lighting.</p>
      <p align="left"><strong>Geology</strong> - Sodium is never found as the free element in
        nature as it is so reactive, however sodium is the sixth most abundant
        element in the earth's crust. The most common sodium containing mineral
        is rock salt (sodium chloride, NaCl, or halite), but it occurs in many
        other minerals including sodium borate (borax), sodium carbonate (soda),
      sodium nitrate (Chile saltpetre), and sodium sulphate (thenardite).</p>
      <p align="left">&nbsp;</p>
      <p align="left"><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="12" id="12"></a>Magnesium (Mg)</FONT></STRONG></p>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The greatest demand for Magnesium is for the
        production of alloys which are strong, light and corrosion resistant
        for use in aircraft, car engines, and missiles. Magnesium is also used
        in flares and fireworks as it produces a bright, white light when burnt.
        Magnesium is used as a reducing agent for the production of uranium and
        other metals. The hydroxide (milk of magnesia), chloride, sulphate (Epsom
        salts), and the citrate of magnesium are all used in medicine. Magnesium
        oxide is used as bricks and liners in furnaces.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Although magnesium is the eighth most abundant
        element in the earth's crust, it is never found in the free metal form.
        Magnesite (MgCO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>), the main ore of
        magnesium, occurs as vein deposits, or as nodules that range in size
        from 1mm to 100cm. Magnesite is commonly associated with serpentinite.
        Magnesium also occurs in dolomite (CaMg(CO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>)<font size="1" class="small">2</font>.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="13" id="13"></a>Aluminium (Al)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Aluminium is a silvery-white metal with a low
        density, high electrical and heat conductivity, corrosion resistance,
        and good malleability (ability to be shaped). As an alloy it can make
        strong materials. Aluminium has a wide range of common uses. Many kitchen
        items (pots and pans, foil, dishes) are made of aluminium. The transportation
        industry uses large amounts of aluminium in cars, trucks, boats, aircraft,
        and aircraft engines. Road signs and high-voltage power lines are made
        mostly of aluminium. It is commonly used in packaging, electrical goods,
        and in light-weight structures in the building industry. Small amounts
        of aluminium are used as abrasives, refractories (materials that retain
        their shape under high temperature), and in water treatment, antiperspirants,
        and bread-making (where it helps the bread to rise).</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Aluminium is not found in the free metal
        form. Bauxite, the most important ore of aluminium, is produced by weathering
        of volcanic rocks during the formation of soil in tropical and sub-tropical
        climates. Australia produces about 40% of the world's bauxite. It is
        found mainly on Queensland's Cape York Peninsula, the Darling Range in
        south-west Western Australia, and at Gove in the Northern Territory.
        Guinea also has large bauxite deposits. Brazil, Jamaica, China and India
        also have bauxite deposits.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - 


Silica, as sand, is a principal ingredient of glass, a material with excellent mechanical, optical, thermal, and electrical properties. It is used in the manufacture of computer chips, lubricants, and concrete and bricks. Doped with boron, gallium, phosphorus, or arsenic, silicon is used in transistors, solar cells, rectifiers, and other electronic solid-state devices.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - 


Silicon is not found free in nature, but occurs chiefly as the oxide, and as silicates. Sand, quartz, rock crystal, amethyst, agate, flint, jasper, and opal are all silicon oxides. Granite, hornblende, asbestos, feldspar, clay, mica are a few of the many silicate minerals. Silicon makes up 25.7% of the earth's crust by weight and is the second most abundant element in the earth's crust.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="19" id="19"></a>Potassium (K)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Most commonly potassium is used in fertilizers 
        - usually as the chloride, sulphate, nitrate, or carbonate form; fireworks 
        (potassium nitrate, KNO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>, and potassium chlorate, 
        KClO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>), and liquid detergents (potassium phosphates).</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Potassium metal is far too reactive to be
        found uncombined in nature but the element is quite abundant in the earth's
        crust. Potassium is found extensively as potash (KOH) and is mined in
        Germany, USA, and elsewhere from minerals such as sylvite (KCl), carnallite,
        and langbeinite, from ancient lake and sea beds.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="20" id="20"></a>Calcium (Ca)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Calcium is used as a reducing agent in the manufacture
        of metals such as thorium, uranium and zirconium and alloys with other
        metals like aluminium, beryllium, copper, lead, and magnesium for some
        useful applications. It is a 'getter' for residual gases in vacuum tubes.
        The greatest use is in the manufacture of quicklime (CaO) and cement.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Calcium metal is never found as the free
        metal in nature, however, calcium is the fifth most abundant element
        in the earth's crust. It is mined mainly from limestone (CaCO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>), gypsum (CaSO<font size="1" class="small">4</font>.2H<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O), and fluorite (CaF<font size="1" class="small">2</font>)
        deposits.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="21" id="21"></a>Scandium (Sc)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Scandium is used in mercury vapour lamps to create
        a light that is very much like natural sunlight. This type of lighting
        is used in photography and television. Scandium is used to make crystals
        for laser research. It also is used in the aerospace industry. An alloy
        of scandium and aluminium is used to make lightweight, strong sporting
        equipment such as baseball bats, bicycle frames, and lacrosse sticks.
        Scandium can be alloyed with titanium to make a strong, heat-resistant
        metal alloy.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Scandium is never found in the free metal
        form. It is usually found in uranium minerals, although very small amounts
        occur in rocks rich in iron or magnesium. Scandium is a much more abundant
        element in the sun and some stars than on earth. Most scandium is recovered
        from thortveitite, or is extracted as a by-product from uranium production
        plants.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="22" id="22"></a>Titanium (Ti)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The most important use of titanium is as a pigment.
        As the whitest substance known, titanium oxide is used as a whitener
        in paints, sugar, sweets, toothpaste. The aerospace industry uses alloys
        of titanium in airframes and engines. Titanium frames for sunglasses
        and sports equipment containing titanium are sought after because they
        are so light and strong. Titanium is non-reactive, non-toxic and corrosion
        resistant, making it perfect for use in replacement hip joints, pace
        makers and pins for bone repair. Because titanium paint is an excellent
        reflector of infrared radiation, it is used in solar observatories where
        heat causes poor viewing conditions. Star sapphires and rubies exhibit
        their star-like light properties because of the presence of titanium
        oxide (TiO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>).</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Titanium metal is not found in the free element
        form. It is found in the minerals rutile (TiO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>),
        ilmenite (FeTiO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>), and sphene. It
        also is present in titanates, in many iron ores, and in many igneous
        rocks. When rutile and ilmenite are present in sediments from igneous
        rocks, they are called 'heavy minerals'. These are an important source
        of titanium. Australia is a world leader in the production of mineral
        sands. Other major producers are South Africa, North America, Canada,
        Scandinavia, and Malaysia.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="23" id="23"></a>Vanadium (V)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Vanadium is used to produce rust-resistant springs
        and steel tools. Its strength and radioactive properties make it useful
        in nuclear applications. About 80% of the vanadium produced is used to
        strengthen steel. Vanadium foil is used to bind titanium to steel. Vanadium
        pentoxide (V<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O<font size="1" class="small">5</font>)
        is used in ceramics and as a chemical catalyst. Vanadium compounds are
        used for dyeing and printing fabrics. A mixture of vanadium and gallium
        is used to produce superconductive magnets.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Vanadium is not found in the free metal form
        in nature. However, it is found in many minerals, the most important
        being carnotite and vanadinite [3Pb<font size="1" class="small">3</font>(VO<font size="1" class="small">4</font>)<font size="1" class="small">2</font>.PbCl<font size="1" class="small">2</font>]. It is also present in some crude oils.
        Vanadium is a trace element in a number of different rocks, and is a
        by-product of some mining operations. Vanadium is found in magnetite
        (iron oxide) deposits that are also very rich in titanium. It is also
        found in bauxite (aluminium ore), in rocks with high concentrations of
        phosphorus-containing minerals, and sandstones with a high uranium content.
        Vanadium is also recovered from carbon-rich deposits such as coal, oil
        shale, crude oil, and tar sands.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="24" id="24"></a>Chromium (Cr)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Chromium is used to harden steel, to manufacture
        stainless steel, and to form alloys. Stainless steel production consumes
        most of the chromium produced annually. Chromium is also used to make
        heat-resisting steel. Some alloys that use chromium have military applications.
        In plating, chromium produces a hard, beautiful surface that resists
        corrosion. Chromium is used by the aircraft and other industries to anodise
        aluminium and it can also be used as a catalyst. It gives glass an emerald
        green colour. It is responsible for the green colour of emeralds and
        the red colour of rubies. Compounds of chromium are used as pigments,
        as oxidising agents and in the textile industry to fix colours in the
        cloth.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Chromium is not found in the free metal form 
        in nature. The most important ore is chromite (FeCr<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O<font size="1" class="small">4</font>), 
        which is found in Turkey, USA, South Africa, Albania, Finland, Iran, Madagascar, 
        Russia, Southern Rhodesia, Transvaal, Cuba, Brazil, Japan, India, Pakistan, 
        and the Philippines. When certain types of magma cool slowly deep inside 
        the earth's crust, chromite crystals are precipitated. Because of their 
        high density, they fall to the bottom where they are concentrated in layers. 
        Chromite is also found in metamorphic rocks such as serpentites.</P>
      <P>&nbsp;</P>
      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="25" id="25"></a>Manganese (Mn)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Steel becomes harder when it is alloyed with
        manganese. Hardened steel is important in the manufacture of construction
        materials like beams (24% of manganese used), machinery (14% of manganese
        used), and cars and planes (13% of manganese used). Manganese by itself
        colours glass an amethyst colour, and is responsible for the purple colour
        of amethyst. It is used to colour bricks and ceramic tiles. Manganese
        is used in the preparation of oxygen and chlorine.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Manganese is not found in the free metal
        form in nature. However, manganese minerals consisting of oxides, silicates,
        and carbonates, are common. Sedimentary manganese forms in shallow, marine
        sedimentary basins. Manganese precipitation usually happens where seawater
        without much oxygen meets oxygenated surface waters. Pyrolusite (MnO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>) is an oxidation product of weathered manganese
        minerals. Like bauxite, it is found in the tropics where high rainfall
        and weathering of rocks are common. Manganese nodules on ocean floors
        contain about 24% manganese. Most manganese comes from ores in Australia,
        Brazil, Gabon, India, Russia, and South Africa.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="26" id="26"></a>Iron (Fe)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Iron is cheap and very abundant so it is used
        for many different things from nails and hammers to bridges and engine
        blocks. However, pure iron is soft and rusts readily so it needs to be
        made into steel by adding small amounts or carbon and other metals to
        make it stronger and more durable. Steel is used to make railway tracks,
        roofing, fencing, pumps and cranes, food containers, pipes and washing
        machines. Iron with only a little carbon in it is called 'wrought iron'.
        It is easily shaped and is used for ornamental work for gates and garden
        furniture.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Haematite, Fe<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O<font size="1" class="small">3</font>, 
        is found throughout the world and is the most important ore of iron. Most 
        of the world's important iron ore resources occur in iron-rich sedimentary 
        rocks known as banded iron formations that are greater than 600 million 
        years old. These deposits occur on all continents. In Australia the major 
        source of iron ore is in the Hammersley Province in Western Australia.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="27" id="27"></a>Cobalt (Co)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Cobalt has been used for centuries to create
        beautiful deep blue glass, ceramics, pottery and tiles. It is also used
        to make paint pigments. Cobalt is used in a number of industrial applications.
        When alloyed with other metals, cobalt creates very strong magnets. Superalloys
        (those developed for use at high temperatures and under stress) containing
        cobalt are used in jet engines and gas turbine engines. These superalloys
        account for nearly half of the cobalt used each year. Some cobalt is
        used to make cutting and wear-resistant materials. A synthetic isotope
        of cobalt, cobalt-60, produces gamma rays. This isotope is used to sterilise
        medical supplies and foods, for industrial testing, and to fight cancer.
        Vitamin B12 contains cobalt. In areas where there is little cobalt in
        the soil, farmers provide salt blocks containing cobalt for their animals
        to lick to get enough cobalt into their diet to allow them to produce
        this vitamin.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Cobalt is not found in the free metal form
        in nature. All cobalt is obtained as a by-product of the mining of other
        elements, such as copper. Canada, Morocco, and Zaire are the biggest
        producers of cobalt. Meteorites often contain cobalt. The ocean floor
        has nodules of metals that form when hot water from deep in the earth
        comes into contact with the cold ocean water. Because these nodules are
        mostly manganese they are called manganese nodules. It is estimated that
        there are millions of tons of cobalt in these nodules. Presently, we
        do not have the technology to retrieve these nodules at a reasonable
        cost.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="28" id="28"></a>Nickel (Ni)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - More than 80 of the world's nickel production
        is used in alloys. At least 3000 alloys of nickel have been identified.
        Stainless steel is the most popular alloy because of its strength and
        corrosion resistance. Stainless steel, which contains mainly chromium
        and nickel, is used in motor vehicles, tools, cutlery, and the chemical
        and building industries. Specialty steels and alloys are used in pipelines,
        aircraft, vehicles and buildings. Nickel-copper alloys are used for marine
        components and desalination plants. Nickel-chromium alloys are used in
        jet engines, high temperature reaction vessels, and for the storage of
        liquefied gases. Other uses of nickel include electroplating, ceramics,
        batteries, coins, glass pigments, electronics and as catalysts.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - The main nickel ore is pentlandite which
        forms when heavy crystallised minerals settle out from magma and become
        concentrated. Currently all Australia's nickel production is from Western

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Copper is an excellent electrical conductor so
        it is widely used in electrical generators, motors, power and lighting
        fixtures and electrical appliances. It is also an excellent heat conductor
        so it is used for thin-walled tubing in air-conditioning and refrigeration
        units, car radiators, hot water services and home heating. Jewellery,
        cooking pots, coins and medals are created from copper. Copper can also
        be alloyed with other metals such as zinc and tin to make alloys such
        as brass and bronze.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Copper is found as the pure metal but more
        common forms are sulfide minerals such as chalcopyrite (CuFeS<font size="1" class="small">2</font>), Bornite (Cu<font size="1" class="small">5</font>FeS<font size="1" class="small">4</font>), and Chalcocite (Cu<font size="1" class="small">2</font>S).
        By far the largest amounts of copper are found in the crust in bodies
        known as porphyry copper deposits. Australia's main copper mining centres
        are in the Mount Isa/Cloncurry region of Queensland and at Olympic Dam
        in South Australia.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="30" id="30"></a>Zinc (Zn)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Zinc is the most used non-ferrous metal after
        aluminium and copper. Almost half of the zinc produced is used for galvanising
        steel to protect it from rust. Galvanised steel is used in many industrial
        applications including structural steel, cars, roofing, fencing, wire
        ropes and cables, tanks, reinforcing bars and fasteners. Zinc is used
        to make brass (with copper), and is used in die casting alloys. Zinc
        compounds and dusts are used in fertilisers, batteries, paint and rubber
        tyres. Zinc is essential to the human body. Zinc is used in vitamin pills,
        cosmetics and sun screens.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - The main zinc mineral is sphalerite (zinc 
        sulphide, ZnS). This contains 67 per cent zinc. Sulfides containing zinc 
        form mainly in a type of submarine hydrothermal deposit called volcanogenic 
        (creating a volcano) massive sulfide deposit, in which seawater on the 
        ocean floor flows through fractures in the oceanic crust. The waters are 
        heated by the nearby magma, producing seawater convection which reacts 
        with neighbouring rocks to dissolve metals. These metals are transported 
        to the ocean floor where they mix with cold bottom waters. The sudden 
        decrease in temperature causes the metals to precipitate and become incorporated 
        into sediments of the ocean floor. Zinc also forms in hydrothermal veins, 
        together with lead and silver. Australia ranks first in the world in economic 
        zinc resources. China and Canada are also significant producers of zinc.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The biggest use of gallium, as gallium arsenide
        (GaAs), is to make lasers because it can change electricity directly
        into laser light. Lasers are used in many different types of appliances,
        including CD and DVD players. Gallium arsenide is also used in light-emitting
        diodes (LEDs), solar cells, semi-conductors, transistors, and some integrated
        circuits. Enormous amounts of gallium have been used in the search for
        a particle known as a solar neutrino. Two such experiments used a total
        of 90 tonnes of gallium. Because of its high boiling point, gallium is
        used to make thermometers that measure very high temperatures. Gallium
        is also used to make mirrors.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Gallium does not easily combine with other
        elements or ions to form ore minerals. However, it is found in very small
        amounts in a number of minerals and ores, the most important of which
        is bauxite (aluminium ore). In fact, gallium is a by-product of aluminium
        production.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Germanium is a metalloid (an element that has
        both metallic and non-metallic properties), making it a semiconductor.
        This means that it conducts some electricity like a metal, but not all
        of the electricity that a true conductor like copper would conduct. Therefore,
        germanium is important in the electronics industry where it is used to
        make transistors and semiconductors. The fibre optic industry accounts
        for a large amount of the germanium used each year. It is also used as
        a catalyst to produce polymers. Because infrared radiation can pass through
        germanium, it is used in infrared equipment. It is also used to treat
        some types of cancers.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Germanium was first discovered and isolated
        from the mineral argyrodite. However, there are no significant argyrodite
        deposits. Germanium is produced as a by-product of zinc and copper-zinc-lead
        ores where it is found as a trace (very small amount) element. Germanium
        also occurs in significant amounts in coal, although not all coal contains
        germanium.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - As a metalloid (an element that has both metallic
        and non-metallic properties), arsenic is a semiconductor. This means
        that it conducts some electricity like a metal, but not all of the electricity
        that a true conductor like copper would conduct. This useful property
        means that arsenic is used to make gallium arsenide semiconductors for
        use in electronic devices. Arsenic is used in glass-making. In the past,
        arsenic compounds were used as agricultural insecticides, but because
        they are so toxic this use has largely stopped. Interestingly, a very
        small amount of arsenic is necessary for good health and growth of animals,
        including humans.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Arsenic very rarely occurs in its pure form 
        in nature. The most common arsenic mineral is arsenopyrite, a compound 
        of iron, arsenic, and sulphur. Many less-common minerals contain arsenic, 
        including orpiment and realgar, which are arsenic sulfides. Most arsenic 
        is obtained not from an ore, but as a by-product in the treatment of gold, 
        silver, copper, and other metal ores. In fact, environmental laws require 
        that arsenic is removed from these ores so that it does not enter the 
        environment.</P>

        applications, mostly it is used in laboratory studies. Rubidium may some
        day be used in space travel in ion engines that will power spacecraft.
        It could also be used to create very thin batteries.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Rubidium does not combine with other elements
        or ions to create minerals. It is found, though, in trace amounts in
        minerals that contain other alkali metals. These include caesium-rich
        and potassium-rich zeolites, pollucite and leucite, and the lithium-rich
        mica called zinnwaldite (a variety of the mineral lepidolite). Most rubidium
        is retrieved from lepidolite and pollucite in pegmatities. A pegmatite
        is an igneous rock where the magma cools so slowly that very large crystals

      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Strontium is recovered from two strontium
        minerals: strontianite (strontium carbonate) and celestite (strontium
        sulphate). Celestite, the more common of these two, is formed by the
        precipitation of salts from natural brines during evaporation of lagoons,

        is a phosphor that gives the red colour in colour television tubes. This
        is a major use of yttrium. It is also used in laser systems. Yttrium
        is alloyed with other metals such as chromium, aluminium, and magnesium
        as it adds strength. Yttrium oxide is used to produce yttrium-iron-garnets,
        which are very effective microwave filters. Because yttrium oxide has
        a high melting point, it helps to make glass more shock resistant, and
        less likely to expand when heated. Yttrium-iron garnet is very efficient
        as a transmitter of sound energy. It also is very good at converting
        sound energy into other forms of energy. Yttrium-aluminium garnet is
        a gemstone that has the appearance (and almost the hardness) of a diamond.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Yttrium is never found in nature in the free
        element form. Yttrium is mainly found in the ores monazite (Ce,La,Nd,Th)PO<font size="1" class="small">4</font>, a rare earth phosphate mineral common in
        heavy mineral sands, and bastnaesite (Ce,La)(CO<font size="1" class="small">3</font>)F
        Both ores contain small amounts of all of the rare earth metals. Another
        mineral, xenotime (YPO<font size="1" class="small">4</font>), also contains
        yttrium. Weathering of rocks containing these minerals concentrates monazite
        and xenotime in heavy mineral placer deposits because of their resistance
        to chemical attack and high specific gravity. Rock samples from the moon
        have a relatively high yttrium content.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Zirconium is used in pumps and valves, and in 
        the cores of nuclear reactors because it is so resistant to corrosion. 
        Zirconium oxide is used to make laboratory crucibles and to line furnaces. 
        Other Zirconium compounds are used in deodorants, flashbulbs, and lamp 
        filaments. Zirconium alloyed with niobium becomes superconductive. This 
        means it is able to conduct electricity with very little loss of energy 
        as a result of electrical resistance. Superconductivity is possible only 
        at very low temperatures. Because zirconium does not absorb neutrons, 
        it is useful as a coating on nuclear fuel parts in nuclear reactors. Zirconia, 
        an oxide of zirconium (ZrO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>), is used as a gemstone. 
        Cubic zirconia, which is hard and clear, is marketed as an inexpensive 
        diamond-like gemstone. Coloured cubic zirconia is sold as imitation jewellery 
        because it looks like many more expensive gemstones.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Zirconium is found in two minerals: zircon

        (zirconium oxide, ZrO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>). Zircon is
        found in very small amounts in some igneous rocks. Weathering of these
        rocks concentrates the minerals such as zircon, rutile and ilmenite to
        form deposits in stream beds, where flowing water has washed away the
        lighter materials. These are called placer deposits. Once they are in
        these deposits they are called heavy minerals because of their high density

        with good strength and other properties useful in pipeline construction
        and arc-welding. Niobium is used in advanced engineering systems such
        as those used in the Gemini space program. Some magnets contain niobium.
        Because of its bluish colour, niobium is used for 'body art' products,
        such as navel rings. The ability of niobium to capture neutrons makes
        it useful in the nuclear industry.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Columbite, the most widespread niobium mineral,
        is an important ore for this metal. Columbite is a natural oxide of niobium,
        tantalum, ferrous iron, and manganese. It forms in granite pegmatites.

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The two largest uses of molybdenum are as an

        Superalloys (those developed for use at high temperatures) of steel and 
        molybdenum are used in gas turbine parts, and chemical processing equipment. 
        Molybdenum is important in the chemical and lubricant industries. It is 
        used in paint pigments. It is used as a catalyst, corrosion inhibitor, 
        and smoke and flame retardant. Molybdenum disulfide is used as a dry lubricant 
        on space vehicles, where it also is resistant to high loads and temperatures. 
        Because of its high melting point (2610&deg;C), molybdenum is used in 
        filament supports in light bulbs, in metal-working dies, and in furnace 
        parts.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Molybdenum is not found in the free metal

        of copper and tungsten production. Molybdenum skarns are the main sources
        of molybdenum. They form when a special type of granite rock come into
        contact with sedimentary rocks. The hot fluids carried by the igneous
        rock change the surrounding rock, and new minerals form from the interaction
        of hot fluids and the cold rock. This process is called contact metamorphism,

      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Technetium is produced artificially. Since
        its discovery, searches for the element on earth have been made without

        for platinum and palladium. It is alloyed with these metals to make electrical
        contacts that need to resist severe wear. The corrosion resistance of
        titanium is improved one-hundred times by addition of only 0.1% ruthenium.
        Ruthenium compounds can be versatile catalysts. Hydrogen sulphide can
        be split catalytically by light using an aqueous suspension of cadmium
        sulphide particles loaded with ruthenium dioxide. This process can be
        used to remove hydrogen sulphide from oil.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Ruthenium belongs to the platinum group elements. 
        As sulphide compounds form in magma, they sink into the floor of the magma 
        chamber and trap the platinum group elements out of the liquid magma. 
        After uplift and erosion of these magmatic rocks, the sulfides, which

        The second largest demand for palladium is in electronics, where it is
        used to make capacitors needed in cellular telephones, personal and notebook
        computers, fax machines, and in car and home electronics. Palladium is
        widely used in dental alloys because it makes them easy to work with,
        strong, and resistant to discolouration. Palladium is used in jewellery,
        either on its own or in 'white gold' (a combination of palladium and
        gold). In this alloy the yellow colour of the gold fades and the alloy
        becomes whiter.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Palladium belongs to the platinum group which 
        includes platinum, palladium, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and ruthenium. 
        These elements commonly occur together in nature and are among the scarcest 
        of the metallic elements. Palladium and the rest of the elements of this 
        group are found in thin layers of metal ores called massive sulfides. 
        These sulphide ores are found in dark igneous rocks with high iron and 
        magnesium content. Palladium is found as the free metal associated with

      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Silver is sometimes found in the free element
        form, but more often in compounds with sulfur such as argentite or tetrahedrite.
        The main silver mineral is tetrahedrite. Warm to hot (hydrothermal) fluids
        generated within the earth form copper, lead and zinc deposits, which
        contain silver. These fluids may be trapped below the surface in cracks
        where galena, with trace silver, and other minerals precipitate to make
        vein deposits. Where limestones occur the fluids fill cavities to form
        rich but patchy lead-zinc-silver deposits. Some fluids can reach the
        ocean floor, in areas of underwater volcanic activity, to form deposits.
        Partially eroded deposits exposed at the surface were relatively easily
        discovered. Examples are the Broken Hill deposit in New South Wales and
        the Mt Isa deposit in Queensland. Silver which has been used for photography

      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Cassiterite (SnO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>)
        is by far the most important tin ore. Tin is also recovered from sulphide
        minerals such as stannite (Cu<font size="1" class="small">2</font>FeSnS<font size="1" class="small">4</font>). Tin occurs in both primary and secondary
        deposits. Primary tin deposits, accounting for about 20% of the tin deposits,
        occur as hard-rock veins or lodes. Secondary tin deposits occur as placer
        deposits. Placer deposits are deposits of heavy minerals in streams,
        valleys, the sea floor or beaches. Tin and tungsten often occur together.
        Most of the world's tin supply comes from China, Malaysia, Indonesia,
        and Thailand.</P>

      <P><STRONG><FONT size=4><a name="51" id="51"></a>Antimony (Sb)</FONT></STRONG></P>
      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The most important use of antimony is to produce
        chemicals that are added to plastics, textiles, rubber, and other materials
        to make them fire-proof. Antimony alloyed with other metals usually makes
        them harder. This is important in lead-acid batteries (the sort found
        in cars) where antimony makes the lead harder and stronger. Some antimony
        alloys, such as Babbitt metal (an alloy of antimony, tin, copper, and
        sometimes lead), are useful as machine bearings because they are soft
        and slippery. Pewter, an alloy of antimony and tin, is used to make such
        things as plates, pitchers and cups. A declining use of antimony is to
        make type metal for printing newspapers and magazines. Antimony is one
        of very few substances (bismuth and water are two others) which expands
        when it cools and freezes. Therefore, type metal containing antimony
        fills every corner of the moulds used to prepare sharp type for printing.
        Electronic printing has reduced this need for antimony. Antimony oxide
        is a brilliant yellow colour, accounting for its use as a pigment. A
        tiny amount of highly purified antimony metal is used in the computer
        industry to make semiconductors. This antimony has to be 99.999% pure!</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Antimony rarely occurs in its pure metallic
        form in nature. It readily combines with other elements, usually including
        sulphur, to form over 100 different minerals. Of these, only stibnite
        (SbS<font size="1" class="small">3</font>) is mined commercially as a
        source for antimony. Antimony is found in trace (that is, very small)
        amounts in silver, copper and lead ores. Some antimony can be obtained
        from these ores when they are smelted.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - Half of the tellurium consumed each year is used
        to in the manufacture of iron and steel products. Tellurium alloyed with
        copper makes the copper more ductile (easier to stretch into wires).
        When alloyed with lead it prevents corrosion. Tellurium is used to make
        catalysts and chemicals. Some of these chemicals are used in the petroleum
        industry and in making rubber. Tellurium is used to make solar panels,
        where it increases the efficiency of power generation. Tellurium is used
        to produce blasting caps for explosives.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Tellurium can be recovered from materials
        left during the refining of copper. Although there are large quantities
        of tellurium in some gold and lead deposits, these deposits are not processed
        for their tellurium content. Tellurium is present in coal, and in some
        lower-grade copper deposits. However, the cost of recovering tellurium
        from these deposits is too high to make it worth the effort.</P>

        in the outer shell of the caesium atom. This clock is accurate to within
        5 seconds every 300 years! Metallic caesium is used in photoelectric
        cells and infrared detectors. Caesium and its compounds are used as catalysts
        in chemical reactions, while Caesium compounds are used in special alkaline
        batteries designed to work in subzero climates. Caesium carbonate is
        used in the production of some glass and glass products. The radioactive
        isotope, caesium-137, is used in radiation therapy to treat cancers.
        Space travel engineers have discovered that burning cesium in space is
        a very efficient form of fuel. It is about 140 times more efficient than
        any other fuel.</P>

        of metals that are designed to withstand high-stress situations, such
        as very high temperatures and pressures. Metals used in these alloys
        include iron, nickel, chromium, titanium, niobium, and hafnium. Because
        of its ability to absorb neutrons, hafnium is used to control fission
        reactions in nuclear reactors, including those that power nuclear submarines.
        Hafnium is also used as a scavenger metal in the retrieval of oxygen
        and nitrogen. A scavenger metal is one which aids in the collection of
        gases without reacting with them to form other compounds.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Hafnium is never found in the free element

      <P><STRONG>Uses</STRONG> - The electronics industry is the largest consumer
        of tantalum; it is used to manufacture capacitors, devices that regulate
        the flow of electricity. Tantalum capacitors are found in mobile phones,
        laptop computers and video cameras. Tantalum is used to make steel alloys
        with desirable properties such as high melting point, high strength,
        and good ductility (ability to be made into wire or thin sheets). These
        alloys are used to make turbine blades for power stations and jet engines,
        and for aircraft and missile manufacture. Because tantalum is very unreactive
        it is useful in the chemical and nuclear industries to line reactors.
        Tantalum is used in surgical procedures as it is tolerated well inside
        the body. For example, it can be used in sutures, and as repair plates
        for the cranium. The oxide of tantalum is used to make special glass
        with a high refractive index for camera lenses.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Tantalum is found in pegmatites mainly in 
        the minerals tantalite [(Fe,Mn)Ta<font size="1" class="small">2</font>O<font size="1" class="small">6</font>] 
        and microlite and wodginite. A pegmatite is an igneous deposit where the 
        magma (molten rock) cools so slowly that very large crystals form. Unusual 
        and rare elements are typical of the minerals found in pegmatites. The 
        largest source of tantalum is from the Greenbushes and Wodgina mines in 
        Western Australia. These mines produce between 25 and 35% of the world's

        that is difficult to repair, such as under water and in outer space,
        because it does not corrode or wear out quickly. Gold coated connector
        pads and gold wires are at the heart of computerized wheelchairs. Gold
        is inert so it can be used safely in the human body as a wire to join

        are used for safety devices in fire detectors and fire extinguishers.
        Bismuth and many of its alloys expand slightly when they solidify (freeze).
        This allows these metals to fill all corners of a mould to form a perfect

        such as pitchblende (mostly UO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>).
        It is fairly abundant in the earths crust with some estimates suggesting
        that every square kilometre of soil to a depth of a 40 cm contains about
        1 g of radium.</P>

      <P><STRONG>Geology</STRONG> - Actinium is found naturally in uranium ores 
        such as pitchblende (mostly UO<font size="1" class="small">2</font>). A tonne of pitchblende 
        might yield just about 0.1 g of actinium.</P>

      <P><font size="4"><strong><a name="ree"></a>Rare Earth Elements</strong></font>
      <p><strong>Uses</strong> - The rare earths' unique properties are used
      in a  wide variety of applications: </p>
      <p>Glass Industry  The rare 
earths, mainly cerium oxides, are used as a purifying and 
de-colourising agent in glass manufacture and for polishing glass 
surfaces. They are also used to add colour to optical glass, and 
lanthanum is used in lenses to increase the refractive index. They 
enhance transmission of light in optical fibres.</p>
      <p>Catalysis 
 Cerium is used in automotive catalytic converters. Lanthanum-rich REE 
compounds are used for petroleum refining.</p>
      <p>Metallurgy  
Rare earth elements improve the structural and thermal stability of 
alloys including hot workability, weld strength, impact resistance and 
high-temperature oxidation. They enhance the fluidity and wetability of 
zinc in galvanizing.</p>
      <p>Magnets  Their strong magnetic 
properties, which endure even at high temperatures, provide 
applications in high strength permanent magnets.      
      <p>Refrigeration - 
  gadolinium is finding increased use in magnetic refrigeration 
  systems.
      <p>Ceramics  REE ( mainly cerium and yttrium 
oxides) are used as sintering aids and in enamels and 
glazes.</p>
      <p>Phosphors  high REE phosphors are used in colour 
television screens and other cathode ray tubes.</p>
      <p>Other  
other uses are for colour control in fluorescent light tubes, in 
electronics and laser technology, in medicine, in storing holographic 
images and in dyes and fertilisers.</p>
      <p><strong>Geology</strong> - REE are never found as free metals in the 
        earth's crust and all their naturally occurring minerals consist of mixtures 
        of various REE and nonmetals. The principal economic sources of REE are 
        <b>bastnaesite</b>, a rare earth fluorocarbonate which occurs in carbonatites 
        and iron deposits of alkaline affinity; <b>monazite</b>, a rare earth 
        phosphate mineral common in heavy mineral sands; <b>xenotime</b>, an yttrium 
        phosphate which occurs in placers, carbonatites and pegmatite veins, and 
        ionic ores in which the REE are adsorbed onto clays. These mineral species 
        account for virtually all production.</p>      
      <p>Weathering of the rocks containing these minerals, led to the concentration
        of monazite and xenotime in heavy mineral placer deposits because of
        their resistance to chemical attack and high specific gravity. Worlds
        resources are concentrated in: Australia, Brazil, China, India, Malaysia,
        South Africa, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the United States.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong><font size="4"><a name="actinoids" id="actinoids"></a>Actinoids</font></strong></p>
      <p><strong>Uses</strong> - The Actinoid group of elements have a variety
        of
uses. Thorium is used in the preparation of the Welsbach mantle, used for portable
gas lights. These mantles consist of thorium oxide (ThO2) with about 1% cerium
oxide and other ingredients. They glow with a dazzling light when heated in a
gas flame. </p>
      <p>Other uses include alloys where they impart high strength and creep
        resistance at high temperatures . They are used to coat tungsten wire
        used in electronic equipment because it has a low work-function and high
        electron emission. </p>
      <p>Glasses containing thorium oxide have a high refractive index and low
        dispersion. They are therefore used for high quality camera lenses and
        scientific instruments.</p>
      <p><strong>Geology</strong> - The elements actinium, thorium, protactinium, 
        uranium, neptunium and plutonium can be found in uranite, the ore of uranium. 
        Thorium is also found in monazite, a calcium, cerium, thorium and rare 
        earth element metal phosphate mineral found in trace amounts in granites. 
        Most monazite is obtained from heavy mineral deposits.</p>
      <p>The remaining actinoid group elements do not 
occur naturally in terrestrial environments and are manufactured 
synthetically.</p>
