    <td><p>Recycling is as old as humanity. It is important both in supplying the raw material needs of the world and in protecting the environment as it avoids waste. </p>
  <p>Recycling happened when a stone age hunter splintered his axe and realised that the fragments would make excellent arrowheads. When metals were first discovered, recycling was at a very high level of efficiency, for when a metal tool or implement became damaged it was far simpler to reforge or remelt it than to make a new one using primary ore. The same is just as true today, for metals can be recycled time and time again without impairing their properties. </p>
  <p>Recycled, or secondary materials as they are often called, are especially useful to the industries that consume them because they are more cost-effective than the primary variety. </p>
  <p>Recycling ensures maximum effective use of the world's natural resources, whether finite or renewable. This is particularly important in the case of non-renewable reserves of metal-bearing ores, for it is our responsibility to preserve our environment for future generations. </p>
  <p>Recycling also saves energy, sometimes dramatically, because none of the mining, processing, transporting or smelting operations are required. </p>
  <p>The pattern of materials use is in theory circular - a sort of perpetual motion. Primary substances are mined, processed and made into products that eventually become redundant, ready to be recycled into the manufacturing process. </p>
  <p>Most of the by-products of manufacturing - often inaccurately referred to as &quot;wastes&quot; - are also fed back through the recycling industry. </p>
  <p>When discarded products and materials are allowed to stray out of the recycling system, they may pollute air, land and water, and disfigure the countryside. Recycling ensures that these valuable resources are used again and again. </p>
  <font size="4">How are metals recycled?</font>
  <p>The technology of metals recycling is extensive and sophisticated. It ranges from machines that compress and shear bulky fabrications into sizes to meet the requirements of any steelmaking furnace, to integrated fragmentation plants that reduce redundant products to fist-size pieces of metal which are then sorted automatically according to type. </p>
  <p>Every year tonnes iron and steel, ranging from offcuts produced by metalworking industries, obsolete oil refineries and redundant ships, to old cars that have finally spluttered to the end of their lives are processed into secondary metal. </p>
  <p>Once a stove, refrigerator, washing machine, dishwasher or freezer breaks down for the last time it is by no means useless. It becomes raw material for the recycling industry which processes millions of these household appliances every year. </p>
  <p>The recycling industry avoids such objects accumulating in unsightly dumps and disfiguring the countryside, thereby providing an environmental service of critical importance. </p>
  <p><font size="4">Aluminium can recycling</font></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Aluminium packaging accounts for 2% by weight, but 50% by value, of materials collected for recycling. It has the highest value of any recyclable packaging material.</li>
    <li>The recycling rate for aluminium cans in Australia in 1998 was 64%.</li>
    <li>Recycling of aluminium cans saves a significant amount of energy.&nbsp; Making aluminium cans from recycled aluminium cans uses only 5% of the energy needed to make the cans from aluminium that has been extracted from the mineral bauxite. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Kaal Australia operates the largest aluminium reprocessing facility in the southern hemisphere. The recycled aluminium produced by Kaal is in turn used to manufacture aluminium end use products in the packaging, transport and building sector.</p>
  <font size="4">Steel recycling</font>
  <p>All steel products, including steel cans contain some recycled steel.</p>
  <p>Steel is the world’s most recycled material. 350 million tonnes are recycled each year.</p>
  <p>Making steel from recycled materials uses up to 75% less energy than making steel from new materials.</p>
  <p>Every tonne of steel from recycled cans saves 1.5 tonnes of iron ore, 0.5 tonnes of coal and 40% of the water used in the production of steel from new materials.</p>
  <p><font size="4">Mobile phone recycling</font></p>
  <p>Mobile phones are shredded and the metals and the plastics separated. The metal shreds are separated into different fractions. Aluminium, ferrous metal and copper fractions are sold to metal refineries, where they are smelted and purified for re-use.</p>
  <p>Printed wiring boards are smelted and then electrolysis is used to separate out the copper from the other materials. The remaining metallic sludge – which contains gold, palladium and platinum – is sent to specialist precious metals plants for recovery. About 65-80% of the material content of a mobile pohone can be recycled and reused. In Australia </p>
  <p>Environmental concerns surrounding the use and disposal of telecommunication products and infrastructure are a matter of fundamental interest to The Australian Mobile Telecommunications Association (AMTA). </p>
  <p>Some mobile phones and their accessories contain toxic substances that may be harmful to the environment when dumped in landfill site or the sea. This is because, at least until recently, there was no easy and safe way that you could dispose of your old mobiles, so they were just thrown in the bin. </p>
  <p>This changed in 1998 when AMTA initiated the Mobile Phone Industry Recycling Program (MPIRP). Now with over 1600 drop-off points around the country there's no need for this - and no excuse for not recycling your old phone. The MPIRP is a voluntary scheme where the participating members provide the necessary funding by paying a levy on each handset sold into the Australian market. The participating members in the program include the four carriers (Optus, Orange, Telstra and Vodafone), service providers (AAPT and Virgin Mobile) and twelve handset manufacturers (Alcatel, Sony-Ericsson, Mitsubishi, Motorola, Nokia, NEC, Panasonic, Philips, Sagem, Samsung, Siemens and RF Industries).

  <p>This is all that remains from a shredded computer hard-drive and all of it is recyclable parts.</p>
  <p>About two-million new computers come into the Australian market every year. Many different base and precious metals are used in the construction of computer components. The likely form and use of metals that are of particular environmental concern are outlined below. </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A small quantity of <b>antimony </b>is present in some inorganic flame retardants, in the form of either antimony trioxide or antimony chloride. </li>
    <li>A small quantity of <b>arsenic</b>, in the form of gallium arsenide, is contained within light emitting diodes (LEDs). </li>
    <li><b>Base metals </b>including aluminium and iron, are used for structural purposes such as component cases and frames, as well as moving parts. </li>
    <li>A small amount of <b>beryllium </b>, in the form of a copper-beryllium alloy (typically 98% copper and 2% beryllium), may be present in the connection slots on older motherboards used for connecting to daughterboards.&nbsp; Small amounts may also be found in &quot;finger clips&quot; used to maintain electrical conductivity in metal housings. </li>
    <li><b>Cadmium </b>occurs in some components of PCBs, such as surface-mounted chip resistors, infrared detectors and semiconductors.&nbsp; There is a small amount of cadmium in plated contacts and switches, and a very small amount of cadmium may have been used as a stabiliser in PVC insulation for wires of the type used in PCs.&nbsp; Rechargeable nickel cadmium (NiCd) batteries have been used in laptop PCs.&nbsp; Newer laptops are likely to contain batteries made from nickel metal hydride (NiMH) or lithium ion (Li) rather than NiCd.&nbsp; Cadmium sulphide has also been used as a phosphor in older CRTs </li>
    <li><b>Copper </b>is used as the principal conducting element within electronic equipment, and can be found in PCBs, cables, and electromagnets in CRTs and storage devices.&nbsp; The percentage of copper used in data cabling varies from approximately 20% to 45%, and use of particular grades generally follows the rule of higher percentages being used where higher capacities or longer run cable lengths are required. </li>
    <li><b>Chromium </b>is used as a hardener or corrosion resistor in steel housings, and as a decorative finish.&nbsp; It is more correctly known as hexavalent chromium or chromium VI. </li>
    <li><b>Lead </b>may be found in a number of components.&nbsp; There is approximately 2-3 kg of insoluble lead encapsulated in the glass matrix of the funnel and faceplate in each CRT (representing approximately 27% of content of the glass screen).&nbsp; There is an additional 15-100 gm of lead present as soluble lead oxide in the 'frit', which is a type of glass solder used to join the faceplate and funnel sections of CRTs.&nbsp; A small quantity of lead is present in the solder used to bond ICs and other small components to PCBs and wiring connections.&nbsp; Lead sulphate may also be used in small amounts as a stabiliser in PVC sheathing for cables and wires.&nbsp; Some early models of laptop computers may contain a sealed lead acid battery. </li>
    <li><b>Lithium </b>is present in backup batteries on the PC motherboard, as well as in some newer laptop batteries. </li>
    <li><b>Mercury </b>is found in the small lamps that provide backlighting in LCDs, however xenon is now being used as a replacement.&nbsp; The average amount of mercury contained in a laptop computer is 0.12 to 5 mg of mercury (approximately one-fifth the amount of mercury in a single household fluorescent light).&nbsp; Mercury switches and relays were traditionally used in large mainframe computers, however it is unlikely that the older mainframe computers are either still in circulation in Australia or represent a significant portion of computer waste currently being sent to landfill.&nbsp; Mercury may also be found in small quantities within batteries and PCBs. </li>
    <li><b>Precious metals </b>including gold, platinum and silver are used to create conductive materials, particularly connectors. </li>
    <li><b>Zinc </b>, in the form of zinc sulphide, is mixed with rare earth metals to create a phosphor coating used on the interior of a CRT screen to convert the kinetic energy of an electron beam to light. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Other metals are often found in small quantities, usually in alloy form.&nbsp; Aluminium is often used in alloy with titanium, and iron is alloyed with nickel, cobalt and manganese in steel housings.&nbsp; Small or trace amounts of particular materials may be found in components that are bonded to PCBs (e.g. antimony in diodes, germanium and gallium in semiconductors, indium and selenium in rectifiers, ruthenium in resistors, and tantalum in capacitors).&nbsp; Phosphor activators and emitters within CRTs (in addition to the zinc or cadmium compounds mentioned above) include europium, terbium, vanadium and yttrium.&nbsp; Additional quantities of particular materials may be found within many different components (e.g. cobalt may be found in NiMH rechargeable batteries).

  <p>Rather than discard the computers to landfill the computer manufacturers need to follow the lead of the mobile phone manufacturers, to develop an effective recycling program for computers.&nbsp; This is happening in the UK and the USA but in Australia the recycling industry has not yet developed the capacity to cope with the volume of computers. Pagers, PDAs, MP3 players and other electronic gadgets pose a similar threat to the environment.</p>
  <p>Some small individual companies such as PC Graveyard are tackling the problem. (<a
