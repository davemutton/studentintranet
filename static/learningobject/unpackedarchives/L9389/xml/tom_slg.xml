		<s2_1>All objects contain particles. The particles can be arranged in different ways. Different arrangements result in different properties . [[br/]][[br/]]In this activity, you will be classifying objects by looking at the arrangement of their particles. [[br/]][[br/]]You can select [[b]]Glossary[[/b]] to check on [[br/]]the meanings of some words. </s2_1>
		<s2_4>To see the particles of objects, you'll need to use this special magnifying tool . [[br/]][[br/]]To try it out, select the [[b]](+)[[/b]] button to magnify the object. The [[b]](–)[[/b]] button will reduce the magnification . Select [[b]]Next[[/b]] once you have tried out the tool.</s2_4>
		<s2_7>Copper</s2_7>
		<s2_12>When an object is magnified, the number in the display area will change. The number shows the magnification of the object.  [[br/]][[br/]]For example,10⁸ means that what you are looking at has been magnified 100 000 000 times. Normally, to see things magnified at this level, you would need an electron microscope .</s2_12>

		<s3_1>This is the area you will be investigating . There are 10 samples for you to look at. You need to look at their particles and then classify them. [[br/]][[br/]]Your task is to find two examples of each type of matter (solid, liquid and gas). Select [[b]]Next[[/b]] to begin your investigations .</s3_1>

		<s4_1b>Select [[b]](+)[[/b]] to magnify the sample until you can see its particles.</s4_1b>
<s4_1c>Now look at the particles and classify the substance.</s4_1c>

		<s4_6>Particles are close together and free to move around.</s4_6>
		<s4_7>Particles are apart and moving fast.</s4_7>
		<s4_8>Correct. [[br/]][[br/]]The particles are locked into a regular arrangement. This gives the object a fixed shape and size.</s4_8>
		<s4_9>Correct.[[br]][[br]]The particles stay close, but can move past each other. This means the size of a sample doesn't change, but its shape can.</s4_9>
		<s4_10>Correct. [[br/]][[br/]]The particles move fast and only the container stops them from spreading out in all directions.</s4_10>
		<s4_11>Incorrect. [[br/]][[br/]]Look again at the arrangement and motion of the particles.</s4_11>

		<s5_1>Do you want to add this sample to your findings ?</s5_1>
		<s5_2>Yes</s5_2>

		<s6_1>These are your findings.[[br]][[br]]Each type of particle arrangement tells you whether the substance is a solid, liquid or gas.[[br]][[br]]Move each label to the correct particle description with its examples. Select [[b]]Done[[/b]] when you are finished.</s6_1>
		<s6_2>Solid</s6_2>
		<s6_3>(Fixed shape and size)</s6_3>
		<s6_4>Liquid</s6_4>
		<s6_5>(Fixed size, but shape can change)</s6_5>
		<s6_6>Gas</s6_6>
		<s6_7>(Shape and size change to fit container)</s6_7>
		<s6_8>Done</s6_8>
		<s6_9>That's not correct.[[br]][[br]]Read the descriptions and look at the examples to help you.</s6_9>
		<s6_9b>That’s still not right.[[br]][[br]]Remember: solids have fixed shapes, liquids and gases flow easily, and gases are very light.</s6_9b>
		<s6_10>Try again</s6_10>
		<s6_11>That's still incorrect.[[br]][[br]]You can either try again, or select [[b]]Show me[[/b]] to see the solution.</s6_11>
		<s6_12>Show me</s6_12>
	</s6>
	<s7>
		<s7_1>Correct. [[br/]][[br/]]Solids, liquids and gases have different properties because their particles are arranged differently.</s7_1>
		<s7_4>In [[b]]solids[[/b]], the particles are close together and vibrating, but held in position. This is why a solid has a fixed size and shape.</s7_4>
		<s7_7>In [[b]]liquids[[/b]], the particles are close together and free to move around. This means that a sample of liquid can change its shape, but its size is fixed.</s7_7>
		<s7_10>In [[b]]gases[[/b]], the particles are far apart and moving fast. A sample of gas will spread out to match the size and shape of any container it is put into.</s7_10>
